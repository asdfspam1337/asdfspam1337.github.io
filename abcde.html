    <h1>Damian and Jack are Friends!</h1>
    <span style="color:gray">5th January, 2020 at 02:49 AM CET</span>
    <p>Today we'd like to address that Damian and Jack are now best friends! We always thought it would happen,
      and guess what? It finally happened!
      They talk to each other every day,
      and they go to each others' houses on the weekends.</p>
    <p>They met at school, and their friendship instantly clicked. They already knew that they'd be great friends then.
      They would play games together, build LEGO, have some tea, and go to the playground to have fun with other kids.
      However, the government decided to destroy that playground, so now they don't have a playground anymore in their area.
      The only things they have left are the good memories from when Aaron and Julian also were at the playground.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you, Aaron?" I said. "I'm fine today," he replied. "Would you like to get a snack after this?"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure, when are you avaliable?", "I just said after this, dummy.". I felt pretty embarrassed after he said that.
      "What about everyone else?", I said. "They can also come with us.", "Talk to you later." "See you later!"</p>
